This is a repository for notes from the journal club of the
[Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics](http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/).
Every week or so graduate students interested in statistical physics, condensed matter,
biophysics, and interdisciplinary physics meet and discuss a cool topic that came up in
their research. They are meant to be digested and self-contained inroductions to 
interesting methods, results, and topics of research.
